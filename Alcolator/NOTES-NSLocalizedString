NSLocalizedString

http://nshipster.com/nslocalizedstring/

Provides string localization in "compile-once/run everywhere fashion"
Replaces all localized strings with their respective translation according to the string tables of the user settings.
It is a Foundation macro that returns a localized version of a string

Two arguments:
key: uniquely identifies the string to be localized
comment: string to provide sufficient context for accurate translation

In practice, the key is often just the base translation string to be used, while comment is usually nil, unless there is an ambiguous context
textField.placeholder = NSLocalizedString(@"Username", nil);

Can also be used as a format string in NSString +stringWithFormat:
In these cases it's important to use the comment argument to provide enough context to be properly translated.

self.title = [NSString stringWithFormat: NSLocalizedString(@"%@'s Profile", @"{User First Name}'s Profile"), user.name];

label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat: NSLocalizedString(@"Showing %lu of %lu items", @"Showing {number} of {total number} of {total number} items"), [page count], [items count]];


NSLocalizedString is a remarkably reliable indicator of code quality. Those who care enough to take a few extra seconds to internationalize are very likely to be just as thoughtful when it comes to design and implementation.

*Always wrap user-facing strings with NSLocalizedString*
Even if you don't plan to localize your app into any other languages, there is immense utility in being able to easily review all of the strings that a user will see.
And if localization is planned, it's significantly easier to NSLocalize your strings as you go along the first time then to try to find all of them after the fact.


Localizable.strings
At runtime, NSLocalizedString determines the preferred language and finds a corresponding Localizable.strings file in the app bundle.
e.g. if the user prefers French, the file fr.lproj/Localizable strings will be consulted

Localizable.strings files are initially generated with genstrings
The genstrings utility generates a .string file(s) from C or ObjC source code files given as the arguments

Localization: the process of translating your app into multiple languages.
Before you can localize your app, you internationalize it.
Internationlization is the process of making your app able to adapt to diff languages, regions and cultures
